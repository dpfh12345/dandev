Trading Strategy

- Start with a bucket of 30 or so securities.
- Run a script that analyzes each every day. Once-per-day is fine for now. HFT is beyond scope.
- Buy when our combination of metrics points to good value. Some ideas:

1) Simple moving averages 
2) Tensorflow-powered short-term price predictions
3) Fundamental valuations (Quick Ratio, etc)

- We should analyze stocks daily and buy/sell when necessary. 
- We should be able to calculate portfolio measurements on a daily basis as well. 
- We could potentially build a simple UI to track performance.

Trades will be executed through Robinhood API. This will cut down on transaction costs.
